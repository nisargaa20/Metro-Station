# Metro-Station

Did my DSA project on one of the best algorithms used to find the shortest path between a given source and destination called "Dijkstra's Algorithm".

Here, I have chosen Green and Purple lines of the Bengaluru Metro as input, represented as graph coordinates in the form of a matrix (directed graph).

What is happening?
Firstly, we enter the source station.
The program then calculates the shortest paths from this source to every other station (51 in total).
It's flexible, easy to use, and understand.
You can also find the shortest path to a specific destination by simply entering both source and destination stations.
